# eCapitalio-Technical-Test

## Context

This is a technical test done for eCapitalio, it took me approx. 7 hours of work.

## Installation

This project was generated on the base of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). To install it, just type:

```
npm i
```

## Usage

```
$ npm run build   Build the application for production use
$ npm start       Start the server in development mode (port 3000)
$ npm now-start   Start the server in production mode (port 5000, build the application before)
$ npm run lint    Launch eslint on the /src folder
```

## Information

The time limitation was one day and I had to learn some library for this application to work. Hence, I didn't have time to improve the application as I would normally do:

1.  No tests have been done for this application, if you want to see how I normally test my application, please look the sources of [this project](https://github.com/lucmerceron/React-Technical-Test).
2.  The design has not been thought long enough to have a good finish.
3.  The design is not responsive.
4.  Errors are not displayed to the user.

Since I didn't know every library I used, I worked dirty in the morning to be sure I could make everything works then refactored the application.
